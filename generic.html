									<h1>Data Visualization Project</h1>
								</header>
								<p>
									<b><u>PURPOSE </b></u> <br>
									The goal is to analyze forest fires that occurred in USA in the span of 24 years captured in the dataset. 
									Some of the questions being researched on a broad level are analyzing the count of fires across states in US, why did they occur and how trend in fires recorded changed over years. 
									Also, analyzing and visualizing factors related to the state hit by the most count of fires.
									
									<br><br>

									<b><u> ABOUT THE DATA: </b></u> <br>
									<b>DATA: </b> Forest Fires in USA  <br>
										<b>LINK:</b> https://www.kaggle.com/capcloudcoder/us-wildfire-data-plus-other-attributes <br>
										<b>SOURCE: </b>KAGGLE <br>
										<b>DESCRIPTION: </b>
										This dataset has approximately 55,000 records of US Wildfires that occurred between 1992 and 2015.
										 This data set is a subset(generated randomly) of the original dataset referred to as the Fire Program Analysis fire-occurrence database (FPA FOD), includes 1.88 million geo-referenced wildfire records, representing a total of 140 million acres burned during the 24-year. 										</p>
										
										 <b><u>DASHBOARD HIGHLIGHTS </b> </u>	 <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/suprita.sharad.bhomkar/viz/U_S_Fires/Dashboard2" class=" ">  [View here] </a> <br>
										 The Dashboard provides a view of the fires at national level and gives an ability to click on a particular state and the dashboard dynamically updates accordingly. 
											<ul>
											<li>The upper left Geographical map graph uses color shading to show the count of fires per state. The Darker the color represents a greater number of fires.</li>
											<li>The lower left Line graph shows the number of fires reported over years and percent change. 
												Also, an added information on the same graph is the percentage change(decrease/increase) in the no. of fires as compared to previous year. 
											</li>
											<li>The upper right Bubble chart represents the Fire count by the causes of the fires. 
												The highest being Debris Burning and followed by Arson, interestingly both are related to human involvement.
											</li>
											<li>The bottom right Discrete Line chart  shows the Acres of land that were burnt by fires per quarter over the years. Different colors represent different years. Quarter Q2 seems to be most affected by fires.
											</li>
										</ul>

										 <b><u> STORYBOARD HIGHLIGHTS  </b></u> <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/suprita.sharad.bhomkar/viz/FiresinTexasStory/Story1" class=" ">  [View here] </a> <br>
										 The Storyboard aimed at focusing on analyzing the factors that had impacts on the Forest fires in the state of Texas, that recorded the highest number of Fires in the time frame in this dataset.
										 The story starts by plotting the fire occurrences in Texas on Map chart for the time period in this dataset. Next story point proceeds to visualize the Fire size class of these occurrences. Next, we see the causes of these fires on the map visualization. Moving forward, we see relationship between Fire Frequency and Damage by Fire Size class. The next few points showcase the cause of fires in each fire class, average time to contain fire and the most widespread fires in Texas.
